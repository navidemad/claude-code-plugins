# Generate Product Requirements Document

Create structured PRDs using the **"land then expand"** approach: minimal core first, focused expansions later.

## Philosophy: Land Then Expand

Modern Claude models work best when they establish patterns first, then layer complexity. This skill creates:

1. **Core PRDs**: Minimal foundation with essential fields only (2-4 substories max)
2. **Expansion PRDs**: Focused enhancements building on completed core

**Why**: Large comprehensive PRDs lead to incorrect assumptions, token inefficiency, and inconsistent results.

## Activation Context

Use when user requests:
- PRD creation for new features
- Feature planning and documentation
- Requirements gathering
- Implementation roadmap
- French: cr√©ation de PRD, planification de fonctionnalit√©, sp√©cification

## Discovery Process

### Phase 0: Determine PRD Type and Explore Codebase

**Step 1: Ask PRD Type**

**CRITICAL**: Ask user to determine if this is a core or expansion PRD:

```
Is this:
1. üå± A new core feature (minimal foundation to establish patterns)
2. üîß An expansion of existing feature (builds on completed core)

Choose [1/2]:
```

**If user chooses "1 - Core Feature":**
- Create minimal foundation PRD
- Max 2-4 substories in single phase
- Essential fields only (example: invoice with just number, date, amount)
- File: `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-core.md`
- Goal: Establish patterns and working code, NOT completeness

**If user chooses "2 - Expansion":**
- Ask: "Which core feature does this expand?" (or check `docs/prds/` for existing core PRDs)
- Create focused expansion PRD building on core
- File: `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-{expansion-name}.md`
- Examples: `-customer-details.md`, `-line-items.md`, `-payment-logic.md`
- Goal: Add one focused aspect using established patterns

**Step 2: Understand Feature Scope**

Ask scoping question:
```
"Describe the [core feature/expansion] briefly (1-2 sentences):"
```

**For Core PRDs - Enforce Minimalism:**
If user describes complex multi-part feature, push back:
```
üå± Core PRD Mode: Let's start with the absolute minimum.

You described: [user's description]

What's the simplest version with just essential fields?
Example: If building invoices, start with just number, date, amount.
Everything else (customers, line items, tax) comes later as expansions.

Simplest core version:
```

**For Expansion PRDs:**
Ask specifically what this expansion adds to the core.

**Step 3: Explore Existing Codebase**

**Before asking detailed questions, understand what exists:**

```bash
# Detect platform
platform=$(bash .claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh)

# Load platform reference
# Read .claude/skills/shared/references/${platform}/conventions.md
```

**For Core PRDs:**
Explore to understand project patterns and conventions.

**For Expansion PRDs (CRITICAL):**
- Find and read the core PRD file
- Identify which files were created in core implementation
- Read those core implementation files to understand established patterns
- Use these patterns as the foundation for expansion

**Explore relevant areas:**

**For Rails:**
```bash
# Find similar features
ls app/models/ app/controllers/ app/services/

# Check for related models
grep -r "class.*Model" app/models/

# Look for authentication/authorization patterns
ls app/policies/ app/controllers/concerns/

# Check existing API structure
grep -r "namespace.*api" config/routes.rb

# For expansions: Read core implementation files
# Example: cat app/models/invoice.rb app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb
```

**For iOS Swift:**
```bash
# Find ViewModels and Views
find . -name "*ViewModel.swift" -o -name "*View.swift"

# Check for service patterns
find . -name "*Service.swift"

# Look for existing navigation
grep -r "coordinator\|router" . --include="*.swift"

# For expansions: Read core implementation files
```

**For Android Kotlin:**
```bash
# Find existing architecture
ls -R app/src/main/java/*/{data,domain,presentation}/

# Check ViewModels
find . -name "*ViewModel.kt"

# Look for repositories
find . -name "*Repository.kt"

# For expansions: Read core implementation files
```

**Document findings:**
```
üîç Codebase Analysis:
- Found similar feature: OAuth login in app/services/auth/
- Existing pattern: Service objects for business logic
- Database: PostgreSQL with ActiveRecord
- API: RESTful endpoints under /api/v1/
- Testing: RSpec with FactoryBot
- Authentication: Devise + JWT

[For expansions: Also document core implementation patterns found]

Will follow these established patterns.
```

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Adapt questions based on PRD type:**

**CORE PRD MODE** - Ask minimal essential questions (5-7 questions):

**Focus on absolute essentials only:**

1. **What are the essential fields/data?** (Minimum viable data model)
2. **Who uses it?** (Target users)
3. **What's the single main user flow?** (One primary happy path only)
4. **How do we know it works?** (Basic success criteria)
5. **Any critical dependencies?** (Required features/services)
6. **What's explicitly out of scope for the core?** (Everything else becomes expansions)

**Important**: If answers suggest complexity, remind user that core is minimal and suggest moving complexity to expansions.

**EXPANSION PRD MODE** - Ask focused questions about the expansion (8-12 questions):

**Context Questions:**
1. **What does this expansion add to the core?** (Specific enhancement)
2. **Which core PRD does this build on?** (Reference existing core)
3. **What core patterns should we follow?** (Based on implemented core files)

**Expansion Scope:**
4. **What new data/fields are needed?** (Additions to core data model)
5. **What user flows does this enable/enhance?** (New or modified flows)
6. **Integration points with core?** (How it connects to existing code)
7. **How do we know it works?** (Acceptance criteria)
8. **Any new dependencies?** (External services, libraries)
9. **Performance considerations?** (If applicable)
10. **Security considerations?** (Auth/validation needs)
11. **What's out of scope for this expansion?** (May become another expansion)

**Important**: Expansion PRDs should be focused on ONE aspect (e.g., customer details OR line items, not both)

### Phase 2: Document Generation

**CRITICAL**: Structure differs for core vs expansion PRDs.

#### Core PRD Structure

File: `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-core.md`

- Output message:
```
‚úÖ Core PRD created: docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-core.md

üìã Core includes: [brief summary]
üö´ Out of scope (future expansions): [list]

üí° Next steps:
1. "Implement the core PRD" - Build minimal foundation
2. After core is complete, create expansion PRDs for: [list]
```

**After Expansion PRD creation:**
- Verify it builds on completed core
- Confirm focused on ONE aspect
- Reference core implementation patterns
- Output message:
```
‚úÖ Expansion PRD created: docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-{expansion}.md

üîß Expands: {core feature name}
üìã Adds: [brief summary]
üéØ Follows core patterns from: [core files]

üí° Next: "Implement this expansion PRD"
```

## Guidelines

**Critical Rules:**
- **ALWAYS ask core vs expansion first** - This determines everything
- **For Core: Enforce minimalism** - Push back on complexity, max 2-4 substories
- **For Expansion: Load core context** - Read core PRD and implementation files
- **Naming convention**:
  - Core: `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-core.md`
  - Expansion: `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}-{expansion-name}.md`

**Platform Detection:**
- Run `.claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh`
- Read `.claude/skills/shared/references/{platform}/conventions.md`
- Use platform-specific terminology:
  - Rails: models, controllers, services, migrations, jobs
  - iOS Swift: ViewControllers, ViewModels, Views, Services, coordinators
  - Android Kotlin: Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, Repositories, UseCases

**Quality Checks:**
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Reference platform patterns from loaded conventions
- For expansions: explicitly reference core implementation patterns
