# Generate Product Requirements Document

Create structured PRDs in `docs/prds/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` with automatic complexity detection and codebase exploration.

## Activation Context

Use when user requests:
- PRD creation for new features
- Feature planning and documentation
- Requirements gathering
- Implementation roadmap
- French: cr√©ation de PRD, planification de fonctionnalit√©, sp√©cification

## Discovery Process

### Phase 0: Detect Complexity and Explore Codebase

**Step 1: Understand Feature Scope**

Ask initial scoping question:
```
"Describe the feature briefly (1-2 sentences):"
```

**Step 2: Auto-Detect Complexity**

Analyze user's description to determine mode:

**QUICK MODE** (triggered by):
- Simple CRUD operations
- Minor UI changes
- Single model/component
- Clear, simple requirements
- Keywords: "simple", "just", "only", "basic"

**FULL MODE** (triggered by):
- Multi-system integrations
- Complex business logic
- Multiple phases/components
- External API integrations
- Keywords: "integrate", "complex", "multi-step", "workflow", "system"

**Inform user:**
```
‚ú® Detected: [QUICK/FULL] mode PRD
üìã This will be a [lightweight/comprehensive] requirements document

Continue? [yes/change mode]
```

**Step 3: Explore Existing Codebase**

**Before asking detailed questions, understand what exists:**

```bash
# Detect platform
platform=$(bash .claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh)

# Load platform reference
# Read .claude/skills/shared/references/${platform}/conventions.md
```

**Explore relevant areas:**

**For Rails:**
```bash
# Find similar features
ls app/models/ app/controllers/ app/services/

# Check for related models
grep -r "class.*Model" app/models/

# Look for authentication/authorization patterns
ls app/policies/ app/controllers/concerns/

# Check existing API structure
grep -r "namespace.*api" config/routes.rb
```

**For iOS Swift:**
```bash
# Find ViewModels and Views
find . -name "*ViewModel.swift" -o -name "*View.swift"

# Check for service patterns
find . -name "*Service.swift"

# Look for existing navigation
grep -r "coordinator\|router" . --include="*.swift"
```

**For Android Kotlin:**
```bash
# Find existing architecture
ls -R app/src/main/java/*/{data,domain,presentation}/

# Check ViewModels
find . -name "*ViewModel.kt"

# Look for repositories
find . -name "*Repository.kt"
```

**Document findings:**
```
üîç Codebase Analysis:
- Found similar feature: OAuth login in app/services/auth/
- Existing pattern: Service objects for business logic
- Database: PostgreSQL with ActiveRecord
- API: RESTful endpoints under /api/v1/
- Testing: RSpec with FactoryBot
- Authentication: Devise + JWT

Will follow these established patterns.
```

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Adapt questions based on mode:**

**QUICK MODE** - Ask only core questions (5-7 questions):

1. **What does it do?** (Core functionality)
2. **Who uses it?** (Target users)
3. **What changes?** (New vs modification of existing)
4. **What's the main user flow?** (Single primary flow)
5. **How do we know it works?** (Success criteria)
6. **Any dependencies?** (Required features/services)
7. **What's out of scope?** (Explicit exclusions)

**FULL MODE** - Ask comprehensive questions (15-20 questions):

**Feature Overview:**
- Core functionality and purpose
- Problem being solved in detail
- Target users and their specific needs
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Scope Definition:**
- New feature vs enhancement
- Platforms/systems affected (already detected)
- Dependencies on existing features
- Integration points
- Explicitly out of scope items

**User Experience:**
- Multiple user flows (happy path + alternatives)
- UI/UX requirements and mockups
- Edge case handling
- Error scenarios and recovery
- Accessibility requirements

**Technical Requirements:**
- Architecture constraints
- Data models needed (detailed schema)
- API/interface requirements (full specs)
- External integrations
- Authentication/authorization approach
- Performance requirements (specific metrics)
- Scalability considerations
- Security requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- Measurable acceptance criteria per substory
- Key performance indicators
- Definition of done
- Rollout strategy

### Phase 2: Document Generation

Create PRD with this structure:

```markdown

- Identify any unclear areas

## Output

Provide user with:
- PRD file path
- Summary of phases and substories
- Confirmation of next steps
- Any items needing clarification

## Guidelines

- **Detect platform first**: Run `.claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh`
- **Load platform reference**: Read `.claude/skills/shared/references/{platform}/conventions.md`
- **Use platform-specific terminology**:
  - Rails: models, controllers, services, migrations, jobs
  - iOS Swift: ViewControllers, ViewModels, Views, Services, coordinators
  - Android Kotlin: Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, Repositories, UseCases
- Adjust detail level based on feature complexity
- Break complex features into smaller substories
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Include realistic time estimates
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Reference platform patterns from loaded conventions
