# Code Review

Perform comprehensive, multi-dimensional code review with actionable feedback.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user:
- Says "review my code" or "code review"
- Asks to "review this" or "check my changes"
- Mentions "review PR" or "review pull request"
- Says "look at my code" before committing
- Wants quality check before pushing

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Scope

Ask what to review:
- **Uncommitted changes**: `git diff` (most common)
- **Staged changes**: `git diff --staged`
- **Branch/PR**: Compare with main branch
- **Specific files**: User-provided file paths
- **Commit range**: Between two commits

Default to uncommitted changes if not specified.

### Step 2: Gather Context

**Execute in parallel:**
```bash
git diff [scope]                # Get the changes
git diff --name-only [scope]    # List changed files
# Check for project guidelines
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then cat CLAUDE.md; fi
# Detect platform (cached for session)
platform=$(bash .claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh)
```

**Load platform-specific reference:**
- Read `.claude/skills/shared/references/${platform}/conventions.md`
- **Rails**: Check strong params, N+1 queries, migrations, ActiveRecord patterns
- **iOS Swift**: Check retain cycles, optional handling, main thread UI, async/await
- **Android Kotlin**: Check Context leaks, Coroutines, ViewModel usage, Hilt DI

### Step 3: Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Analyze across multiple dimensions:

#### A. Code Quality
- **Readability**: Clear names, logical structure, appropriate comments
- **Maintainability**: DRY principles, proper abstractions, low coupling
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity, deep nesting, long methods
- **Code Smells**: Duplicated code, large classes, long parameter lists
- **Naming**: Consistent, descriptive, follows conventions

#### B. Architecture & Design
- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate pattern usage (MVC, MVVM, Repository, etc.)
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection
- **Separation of Concerns**: Proper layering, clear boundaries
- **Coupling**: Dependencies managed well, interfaces used appropriately
- **Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together

#### C. Security
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper access controls, session management
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, input sanitization
- **Data Exposure**: No sensitive data in logs, proper encryption
- **Secrets**: No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or passwords
- **API Security**: CORS, rate limiting, proper error messages (don't leak info)

#### D. Performance
- **Database**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient queries
- **Caching**: Appropriate use of caching, cache invalidation
- **Algorithms**: Time/space complexity, unnecessary iterations
- **Resources**: Memory leaks, connection pooling, file handling
- **Mobile**: Battery impact, network usage, memory management

#### E. Testing
- **Coverage**: Adequate tests for new/changed code
- **Quality**: Tests are meaningful, not just for coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, null handling, error paths
- **Organization**: Clear test structure, good test names

#### F. Platform-Specific

**Detect platform first** using `.claude/skills/shared/scripts/detect_platform.sh`, then apply platform-specific checks from the loaded reference file:

**Rails** (check `.claude/skills/shared/references/rails/conventions.md`):
- Strong parameters properly defined
- Migrations are reversible
- Background jobs for long operations
- Proper HTTP status codes
- ActiveRecord best practices (includes, joins vs where)
- No business logic in controllers
- N+1 query prevention
- Counter cache usage
- Database indexes

**Android Kotlin** (check `.claude/skills/shared/references/android-kotlin/conventions.md`):
- Lifecycle awareness (Activity/Fragment lifecycles)
- No Context leaks (use ApplicationContext when appropriate)
- Background threading with Coroutines
- Resources properly managed
- ViewModel usage with StateFlow
- Material Design guidelines followed
- Hilt dependency injection patterns
- Repository pattern implementation

**iOS Swift** (check `.claude/skills/shared/references/ios-swift/conventions.md`):
- No retain cycles (use weak/unowned references)
- UI updates on main thread
- Minimize force unwrapping (use guard/if let)
- Proper memory management
- Async/await for concurrency
- SwiftUI best practices or UIKit patterns
- MVVM architecture compliance
- Combine framework usage

### Step 4: Check Project Guidelines

If `CLAUDE.md` exists:
- Read project-specific conventions
- Check code against stated rules
- Note violations with high confidence
- Reference specific guidelines in findings

### Step 5: Categorize Findings

Group issues by severity:

**üî¥ Critical (Must Fix)**:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Crashes or exceptions
- Breaking changes without migration
- Hardcoded secrets

**üü† Major (Should Fix)**:
- Performance problems (N+1 queries, memory leaks)
- Missing error handling
- Violation of project guidelines
- Missing tests for critical paths
- Architecture violations

**üü° Minor (Consider Fixing)**:
- Code style inconsistencies
- Minor duplication
- Missing comments on complex code
- Opportunities for refactoring
- Minor performance optimizations

**‚úÖ Positive (Done Well)**:
- Good patterns used
- Excellent test coverage
- Clear documentation
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices

### Step 6: Generate Review Report

Create structured, actionable report:

```markdown
# Code Review Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewer:** Claude Code (code-review skill)
**Scope:** [What was reviewed]
**Files:** X files changed
**Overall Status:** ‚úÖ Approved | ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes Requested | ‚ùå Major Issues

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence overview of changes and assessment]

**Key Findings:**
- üî¥ X critical issues
- üü† Y major issues
- üü° Z minor suggestions
- ‚úÖ Many positive aspects

---

## Critical Issues üî¥

### 1. [Issue Title]
**File:** `path/to/file.rb:45`
**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Security

**Problem:**
```ruby
# Current code showing the issue
api_key = "sk_live_12345..."  # Hardcoded secret
```

**Why This Matters:**
API credentials exposed in version control can be extracted by anyone
with repository access. This is a severe security vulnerability.

**Recommended Fix:**
```ruby
# Use environment variables
api_key = ENV.fetch('STRIPE_API_KEY')
```

**Action Required:**
1. Move credential to environment variable
2. Rotate the exposed API key immediately
3. Add to .env.example for documentation
4. Update deployment docs
