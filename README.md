# Yespark Team Claude Code Marketplace

AI-powered skills for complete product development workflow: from PRD creation to implementation, commits, and pull requests. **Platform-agnostic** - adapts to your tech stack automatically.

## Overview

This marketplace provides **5 intelligent skills** that Claude Code automatically activates based on your needs. No slash commands to remember - just describe what you want, and Claude uses the right skill.

**Skills are model-invoked** - Claude decides when to use them based on your conversation, making your workflow natural and intuitive.

**Truly platform-agnostic** - Works with Ruby/Rails, JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java/Kotlin, Swift/iOS, React, Vue, Angular, and more. Skills detect your tech stack and adapt automatically.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Activated When You Say... |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| **generate-prd** | Create comprehensive PRDs with phases and substories | "create a PRD", "plan this feature", "document requirements" |
| **implement-prd** | Implement PRDs with automatic progress tracking | "implement the PRD", "continue implementing", references a PRD file |
| **commit** | Smart git commits with Conventional Commits format | "commit this", "save my work", "create a commit" |
| **create-pr** | Generate comprehensive PR descriptions | "create a PR", "make a pull request", "submit for review" |
| **code-review** | Multi-dimensional code quality analysis | "review my code", "code review", "check my changes" |

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "yespark-team-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "yespark/yespark-claude-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": [
    "yespark-team-marketplace:product-workflow-skills"
  ]
}
```

Trust the folder in Claude Code - skills are immediately available!

### How It Works

Unlike slash commands, **you don't invoke skills directly**. Just have a natural conversation:

```
You: "Let's create a PRD for the new payment feature"
Claude: [Activates generate-prd skill, asks clarifying questions, creates PRD]

You: "Now implement this PRD"
Claude: [Activates implement-prd skill, detects your tech stack, starts implementing]

You: "Commit my changes"
Claude: [Activates commit skill, analyzes changes, generates commit message]

You: "Review my code before I push"
Claude: [Activates code-review skill, performs comprehensive analysis]

You: "Create a pull request"
Claude: [Activates create-pr skill, generates PR with full description]
```

## Platform Support

**Automatically detects and adapts to:**

### Supported Platforms
- **Ruby on Rails** - Models, controllers, services, migrations, ActiveRecord patterns, RSpec/Minitest
- **iOS/Swift** - MVVM architecture, SwiftUI/UIKit, ViewModels, Combine, async/await
- **Android/Kotlin** - Clean Architecture, MVVM, Coroutines, Hilt DI, Jetpack Compose

### Detection Method
Skills automatically detect your platform by analyzing project files:
- **Rails**: Presence of `Gemfile` with `gem "rails"`
- **iOS Swift**: `.xcodeproj` folder, `Podfile`, or `Package.swift`
- **Android Kotlin**: `gradle.properties` file at project root

Once detected, skills automatically load platform-specific conventions and best practices from reference files, ensuring code generation follows your platform's standards.

## Skills in Detail

**Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents**

Claude asks clarifying questions and generates structured PRDs in `docs/prds/` with:
- Problem statement and solution overview
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Multiple implementation phases
- Substories with acceptance criteria
- API/interface specifications
- Data schema design
- Testing strategy
- Security and performance considerations

**Platform-aware sections adapt to your stack** - automatically tailors PRD structure for Rails backend, iOS mobile, or Android mobile development.

## Key Advantages of Skills vs Commands

**Skills (This Marketplace):**
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation - no syntax to remember
- ‚úÖ Claude decides when to use them
- ‚úÖ Context-aware activation
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure - details loaded as needed
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration through git
- ‚úÖ Platform-aware - adapts to Rails, iOS Swift, or Android Kotlin

**Traditional Commands:**
- ‚ùå Must remember exact command syntax
- ‚ùå Must explicitly invoke with `/command`
- ‚ùå Less contextual
- ‚ùå All logic loaded upfront
- ‚ùå Often platform-specific

## Requirements

- **Claude Code CLI** (latest version with skills support)
- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for PR creation
- Your specific development tools (language runtimes, build tools, etc.)

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Skills

Skills are in `.claude/skills/` - you can customize them:
1. Modify SKILL.md files to adjust behavior
2. Add reference files for skill-specific docs
3. Commit changes so team gets updates

### PRD Templates

The generate-prd skill creates structured PRDs. Customize the template by editing `.claude/skills/generate-prd/SKILL.md`.

### Project Guidelines

Create `CLAUDE.md` in your project root with:
- Coding conventions
- Architecture decisions
- Testing requirements
- Security policies

The code-review skill automatically checks against these guidelines.

## Sharing with Your Team

### Method 1: Marketplace (Recommended)
1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Team members add marketplace to their `.claude/settings.json`
3. Skills automatically available in all their projects

### Method 2: Direct Copy
1. Copy `.claude/skills/` to your project
2. Commit to git
3. Team members pull and get skills immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Activating
- **Check installation**: Verify `.claude/settings.json` has correct marketplace config
- **Trust folder**: Make sure you trusted the project folder
- **Restart Claude Code**: Close and reopen Claude Code
- **Be explicit**: Say "use the generate-prd skill" to force activation
- **Check logs**: Run `claude --debug` to see skill loading errors

### Wrong Platform Detected
- Skills detect from project files (Gemfile with rails gem, .xcodeproj, gradle.properties)
- Make sure these marker files are present at project root
- You can mention platform explicitly: "implement this as a Rails feature"

### Skill Errors
- Check required tools are installed (git, gh CLI)
- Verify permissions (can Claude write files?)
- Check Claude Code version (skills require recent version)

## Support
